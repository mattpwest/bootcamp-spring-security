# Spring MVC Exercises

These are the practical exercises for the Spring Security module of the Entelect
Graduate Bootcamp 2018. This uses the web application you built in the Spring MVC
exercises as a starting point and then adds on some basic security functionality.

The format of the exercises is for you to check out a branch with the exercise in
its start state - these are named `exercise[0-9]`. Once you have the branch for
the exercise read the updated `README.md` for instructions on what you must
accomplish to complete the exercise.

The solution for each exercise will be in a branch named `solution[0-9]` - try
to complete the exercises on your own before looking at the solution...

It is recommended that branch off from each `exercise` branch when you start,
that makes it easy to commit and compare to the solution branch if you do get
stuck.

Begin by checking out the tag `exercise1` with `git checkout exercise1`.
